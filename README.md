# Code Refactor Challenge

Refactor code by meeting standards in web accessibility and following the Scout Rule. 
Improve codebase for long term sustainability and ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, 
consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before 
each element or section of the page.
